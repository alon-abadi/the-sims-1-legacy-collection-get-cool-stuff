# The Sims 1 - Get Cool Stuff  

This collection includes items originally created by Maxis and released to the public under the "Get Cool Stuff" promotion. These files were originally distributed as an `.exe` installer, which no longer works with the Steam version of The Sims 1: Legacy Collection.  

To make these items available again, they have been extracted and reverse-engineered from the original installer.  

### Notes:  
- Some of these items were later included in expansion packs or the Deluxe edition. If you encounter duplicates, feel free to skip them.  
- The **Green Set** also includes the **Crimson Collection**, a set of Maxis Match extras that used to be available on SimSpot.space (now defunct). This collection expands on the McDonald's bed and dresser set with matching items.
